From the depths of my heart, I pay homage to you!</em> </p>
<p>In order to give a concise explanation of the Tenth Day, I shall present: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A concise life-story and presentation of the excellent qualities of the Second Buddha of Uá¸á¸iyÄna</li>
<li>An introduction to the great festival, the Tenth Day</li>
<li>An explanation of the gaá¹acakra</li>

</blockquote>
<h3>1. Concise Life-Story and Presentation of the Excellent Qualities of the Second Buddha of Uá¸á¸iyÄna</h3>
<p>The great sovereign amongst the victors of the three times, the glorious Uá¸á¸iyÄna, is indivisible from the primordially free Samantabhadra, the naturally-arisen, primordial dharmakÄya. From the all-encompassing space of the dharmakÄya, spontaneously accomplished, he becomes the saá¹bhogakÄya of the five perfections. As its natural expression, he arises, defying imagination, as a completely liberated nirmÄá¹akÄya. He manifests as the Guru in infinite forms, in infinite buddhafields, in order to guide beings in inconceivable and inexpressible ways. Thus he is the single embodiment of the sphere of activity of all the buddhas. In our particular buddhafield, he became renowned as the unrivalled great master PadmÄkara, the Lotus-Born. His arrival was foretold in both sÅ«tra and tantra, by the completely perfect buddhas. </p>
<p>As stated in the <em>SÅ«tra of Predictions in Magadha</em>:<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the Milk Grove at KuÅinagara, just before entering nirvÄá¹a, the completely perfect Buddha ÅÄkyamuni demonstrated the impermanence of everythingâworld and beings, outer and inner. As the Sage gave prophecies about his passing, many of the ÅrÄvakas wept and fainted. When they regained consciousness, they wept again and cried out in pain to the Blessed One: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âKyema KyehÃ¼! Protector of the world, if you do not remain, then who will save us from this darkness?â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Blessed One sighed before the assembly. Then, with a caring smile, the sage spoke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âKyeho! Twelve years<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> after I pass into nirvÄá¹a,<br/>
On the northwestern border of the land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna,<br/>
Within the immaculate waters of KoÅa Island,<br/>
There, upon the heart of a lotus flower<br/>
A person will appear, superior to me.<br/>
His name will be PadmÄkara, the Lotus-Born.<br/>
He will arise as the Lord of Teachings of sÅ«tra and tantra.<br/>
Thus, do not weep!<br/>
Like a supreme panacea among medicines,<br/>
With infinite powers the Lotus-Born will come.<br/>
Thus, do not grieve!<br/>
Like the sun and the moon among stars,<br/>
With infinite powers the Lotus-Born will come.<br/>
Thus, do not despair!<br/>
Like the wish-fulfilling gem among jewels,<br/>
With infinite powers the Lotus-Born will come.<br/>
Thus, why be sad?<br/>
The darkness of the world will be dispelled!â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he had spoken thus, the whole assembly rejoiced and reflecting upon his words soothed their pain. However, the Blessed One knew that doubts could still arise about the arrival of this superior being. Thus, he spoke again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âSurpassing entirely all the victors of the three times, this exalted, noble, and marvellous being will excellently take birth, unstained by a womb, in a naturally-arisen body. Thus, through his mode of birth he will be an exalted being. Unaffected by old age and decay, a guide to all those who need to be tamed, thus he will be a noble one. He will be unaffected by death or by the extremes of saá¹sÄra. Thus his longevity will be unexcelled. Defeating the mÄras, he will prevail, completely victorious over the mÄras. Thus he will be unexcelled. Without having to traverse or train in the path, without ever having to take another birth again, he willâin one body and a single lifetimeâdelight in the very heart of the Dharma, the vehicle of all the buddhas. Thus he will be unexcelled. Therefore, if you were to ask, I would tell you that this being will be none other than the Blessed Protector himself, the teacher of unchanging light, AmitÄyus in actuality.â</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Tantra of the Assembly of Herukas</em><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emaho! From the heart of a lotusâ<br/>
The embodiment of enlightened body, speech and mind<br/>
The strength and majesty of resplendent qualities and activitiesâ<br/>
Evoked by the gods, this I will manifest<br/>
As crown prince of the victors, the jewel of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <em>The Tantra of the Perfect Embodiment of the Unexcelled Nature</em>,<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten years and two<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> after I pass into nirvÄá¹a,<br/>
The Supreme Victor in all worlds,<br/>
Whose name will be PadmÄkara,<br/>
Will take birth in Uá¸á¸iyÄna upon a blossoming lotus<br/>
And teach Secret Mantra. This is my prophecy! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Magical Net of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«</em>,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Glorious Lotus Born Buddha is<br/>
The treasure of all-knowing wisdom,<br/>
The holder of the manifold Magical Net, the king of tantras,<br/>
The greatest vidyÄdhara amongst all buddhas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was it clearly foretold in both sÅ«tra and tantra. The protector AmitÄbhaâBuddha of Boundless Lightâsingle embodiment of the compassion, power and blessing of all the victors, sent forth from his heart a golden vajra, marked with the syllable <em>hrÄ«á¸¥</em>, which descended onto a blossoming lotus in the immaculate sparkling waters of an ocean in the north-west of Uá¸á¸iyÄna. It transformed into an exquisitely beautiful eight-year-old boy, adorned with all the major and minor marks of perfection, and holding a vajra and lotus. There he remained, teaching the profound Dharma to the gods and á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the island. </p>
<p>It so happened that Uá¸á¸iyÄnaâs King Indrabhodhi<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> was out on the ocean at the time. He had no royal heir and his treasuries were empty â thanks to his immense generosity to the poor and his devotion to the Three Jewels. He had set out with a search-party on a voyage to find a wish-fulfilling jewel on an isle within the ocean. As they returned with the jewel, they spotted the miraculous child â first the dharma minister Triguá¹adhara<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> and later King Indrabodhi himself. Taking the child back to the palace, Indrabodhi installed him as the crown prince and asked to take his seat upon a precious throne. He was known then as PemajungneÌ or PadmÄkara, âThe Lotus-Bornââas well as TsokyeÌ DorjeÌ, âLake Born Vajraâ. In due course he married the queen PrabhÄvatÄ«<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> and ruled the kingdom of Uá¸á¸iyÄna according to the Dharma, thus bringing its citizens to maturity and liberation. </p>
<p>Skilfully, he escaped the affairs of government and went to practice yogic discipline in the eight great charnel grounds, such as ÅÄ«tavana in the south. Thus he became known as ÅÄntaraká¹£ita, âPreserver of Peace', bringing the á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the charnel grounds under his sway. He received empowerments and blessings from the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«sâamong them, VajravÄrÄhÄ«âand in each of the eight charnel grounds he accomplished one of the maá¹á¸alas pertaining to the great sÄdhanas of the Eight Entrustments.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> Each time the Lotus-Born gained the signs of accomplishment, the deities and the masterâs mind became inseparably united. </p>
<p>Then the Lotus-Born travelled to eastern India, where in the red rock cave at Garuá¸a Grove he met the great master Prabhahasti, from whom he perfectly received all the tantric teachings. He experienced pure visions of the deities of the vajradhÄtu-maá¹á¸ala,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> and displayed the signs of accomplishment. Thus he became known as ÅÄkya SengÃ©, âLion of the ÅÄkyasâ. </p>
<p>Although already a great lord who had accomplished the definitive meaning, he nonetheless appeared in a way that enables us to understand him. The Lotus-Born sought out many accomplished siddhas, travelling to all the great sacred sites of India, and receiving the MahÄ-, Anu- and Ati-yoga teachings. Moreover, displaying the resolution of all doubts concerning the causal vehicle of characteristics,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> he became known as the scholar Loden ChoksÃ©, âWise Seeker of the Sublimeâ. </p>
<p>Travelling to Zahor, the Lotus-Born took the royal princess MandÄravÄ as his consort for sÄdhana practice. Together they went to the MÄratika cave, where they practiced the sÄdhana of longevity. The Protector of Boundless Life, AmitÄyus, appeared, empowered, and blessed them. Thus their bodies were transformed into vajra-bodies beyond all birth, old age, and death. Knowing that the time had come to tame the kingdom of Zahor, they returned, and through many marvellous miracles skilfully tamed its citizens, who had no knowledge of what to adopt and abandon. Thus the entire kingdom was established in the sacred Dharma, and he was known as Padmasambhava, âLotus-Bornâ. </p>
<p>Returning to Uá¸á¸iyÄna, they were captured by evil minsters and burned on a pyre. The master turned the pyre into a lake to the astonishment of the crowd, and was found unperturbed and radiant, seated on a lotus. Thus he brought Indrabhodi and the entire kingdom of Uá¸á¸iyÄna onto the excellent path of liberation and became known as Pema Gyalpo, âLotus Kingâ.</p>
<p>Taking his seat among the naturally arisen stÅ«pas at Lhundrup Tsek â the spontaneous mound â and at the other charnel grounds, he bound the á¸ÄkinÄ«s and dharmpÄlas as his servants. Taking their heart and life-force, he established them as guardians of the teachings. Thus he became known as Nyima Ãzer, âRays of the Sunâ. </p>
<p>Other stories tell that at one point he drank five hundred measures of beer and was asked to settle his debt before sunset. Since he was unable to pay, he transfixed the sun in the sky, so it did not set for seven days. PadmÄkara displayed countless miracles of this sort, totally defying the imagination. Abiding as a heruka in this way, he earned renown as Nyima Ãzer, âRays of the Sunâ, or Nyima Dzin, âSeizer of the Sunâ. </p>
<p>At the Vajra Throne in Bodh Gaya, the Lotus-Born challenged five hundred evil heretics, defeating them in debate with logic and magic. When they cast evil spells against him, he reversed their magic with the aid of a wrathful mantra given to him by the á¸ÄkinÄ« MÄrajitÄ. Thus he liberated the heretics and burned their city to the ground. Any who remained were taken under his care and established on the Buddhist path. Thus he became known as SengÃ© Dradok, âLionâs Roarâ. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Lotus-Born journeyed through all of Indiaâthe Vajra throne in the centre, the eight cardinal and intermediate directions, and all its various lands, great and small. Everywhere, the Lotus-Born tamed beings through the four enlightened activities, establishing the Dharma and thus immeasurably benefiting beings. </p>
<p>Travelling to Nepal, the Lotus-Born took the Newar ÅÄkyadevÄ« as his consort. Together they entered retreat and practiced ÅrÄ« Heruka, Essence of Great Bliss, at YangleshÃ¶ in Nepal. They experienced visions of the nine deities of the ÅrÄ« Heruka maá¹á¸ala and gained each and every siddhi without exception. </p>
<p>Now follows the story of how the Lotus-Born came to the snowy land of Tibet. The Dharma king Trisong Detsen had invited the great scholar ÅÄntaraká¹£ita<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> to build a temple as a support for practice. This antagonised the evil spirits of the land, who embarked on a campaign of disaster, preventing the construction of the temple. ÅÄntaraká¹£ita spoke to the king, urging him to seek help: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âAt the Vajra Throne in India resides a heart-emanation of AmitÄbha, the Buddha of Boundless Light. Miraculously born, free from birth and death, he simultaneously knows past, present and future. He is renowned as the Lotus-Born, the great master from Uá¸á¸iyÄna who makes spirits and demons his servants. If you invite him to come, he will be able to accomplish all your plans.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this, the king dispatched messengers laden with goldâboth bricks and dustâto invite the Lotus-Born. Clairvoyant, the master knew when the messengers had left. From India he travelled by miraculous means to the cave of Yari Gong<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> in Mangyul, where he awaited their arrival. Despite already knowing the answer, when they arrived he asked them, âWhere are you going?â </p>
<p>The messengers replied, âWe were sent by the King of Tibet with the words âGo to Indiaâ, to invite the great master PadmÄkara, the Lotus-Born.â</p>
<p>The master stood before them, without his feet touching the ground, and he said, âI am the one!â This inspired great faith in them all, and gratefully they prostrated to the Lotus-Born, making circumambulations and offering the gold bricks and dust. The master responded thus, âFor me, all appearances are gold!â He threw the gold back in the direction of Ngari, and the messengers were bereft.</p>
<p>âNo need to feel sad! If you need gold, pick up some sand!â </p>
<p>The messengers picked up some sand and instantly, to their amazement, the master transformed it into gold. </p>
<p>âSince your Tibetan King and I share a connection through previous aspirations, I will come to Tibet.â </p>
<p>As they made their way to the dark land of Tibet, they were received by the âlaymanâ Dorje Lekpa, most powerful of all the gods and demons of the land, together with his retinue of 360 siblings and attendants. They offered respect to the Lotus-Born and swore their allegiance. As the Lotus-Born reached Palthang, the twelve Tenma goddesses started creating obstacles, sending down a volley of twelve meteoric lightning bolts. Spinning the ladies overhead with the threatening mudrÄ, he turned them as black as twelve lumps of charcoal. The most powerful of them fled and the remaining eleven were terrified, offering their hearts and life-force, and swearing their allegiance. When the master reached Oyuk Rong, the last of the goddesses squeezed herself in between two mountains to the left and right, but the master quickly came upon her from above. Frightened, she fled to Namtso Lake in the north. The master flung his vajra into the lake, striking one of her eyes. The lake began to boil, flaying the flesh off her bones. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âSuccessor of the Buddha, DorjÃ© TÃ¶treng TselâMighty Powerful Vajra! Stop this obstruction! Please let me go! I will heed your every command and be your servant!â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Touching her head to the Lotus-Bornâs feet, she offered her life-force. The master bound her under oath and named her Gangkar ShamÃ© DorjÃ© YÃ¼drÃ¶nma, âFleshless Turquoise Lamp of the White Glacierâ. </p>
<p>Next, the master went to the Thangla foothills, where Nechen Thangla greeted him with obstacles of rock-like hail<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> and meteoric lightning. PadmÄkara shot fire from his threatening mudrÄ, melting the peak of Thangla with its heat. Terrified, Thangla transformed into a child with turquoise locks. He and all his retinue of gods and spirits offered their life-force, becoming guardians of the teachings. In this way the Lotus-Born, using fiercest mudrÄs, overpowered and subjugated each and every spirit, from the most powerful to the lowest amongst the entire eight classes of gods and demons. Thus he became known as Dorje DrolÃ¶, âMighty Vajra Wrathâ.</p>
<p>On the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, the Lotus-Born finally appeared in physical form within the heart of Tibet. There he was received by the king, the ministers, and subjects with various offerings and music. This is how they invited him to Drakmar Drinzang.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> When the king failed to offer him respect, the Lotus-Born manifested fire from his hand, singeing the royal robes. Immediately the king recognized his mistake and offered homage to the master. The Lotus-Born proceeded to the top of Mount Hepori, where he performed a vajra dance and restrained all Tibetâs malevolent gods and spirits beneath his command. Thus Glorious SamyÃ©, the inconceivable, unchanging, spontaneously accomplished temple, was built as a clear representation of our own world-system, with Mount Meru in the centre, then the four continents, the subcontinents, the sun and moon, and everything encircled by an outer perimeter, a ring of iron mountains. SamyÃ© became renowned throughout the three worlds, the main object of worship for gods, humans, and nÄgas.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> More than one hundred temples were built there. Through various magical emanations, the great master then performed the consecration (<em>rabnÃ©</em>) ceremony. For this, the deities of the main shrine, ground-floor, and surrounding temples gathered outside, whereas the deities of the middle and upper floors came down into the main shrine and the deities of the wall-paintings were seen vividly outside. The central deities of great awakening were seen to smile, emitting light rays, and fire shot forth from the curtains covering the wrathful gatekeepers, clearly seen by all. The HayagrÄ«va statue from the Ärya PÄlo Temple neighed three times, heard by all. Like this, inconceivable and marvellous miracles occurred. </p>
<p>Within the secluded Chimpu Cave of glorious SamyÃ©, the Lotus-Born transmitted teachings to his principal disciplesâthe sovereign king, his heir(s), and Karchen YeshÃ© Tsogyal. He gave them the teachings of MahÄ-, Anu- and Ati-yoga, as well as countless other profound and uncommon teachings. As his disciples, the Lotus-Born took the twenty-five accomplished disciples, the nine heart disciples, translators such as Vairocana, vidyÄdharas such as DorjÃ© DÃ¼djom, the first ordained monks, such as KÃ¶n Luâi Wangpo, and countless numbers of other fortunate disciples, such as the á¸ÄkinÄ«s who accomplished rainbow-body. Thus with immeasurable kindness the Lotus-Born turned the wheel of the Dharma of the unsurpassed secret. </p>
<p>For the benefit of beings in degenerate future times, the Lotus-Born hid profound pith-instructions in the form of treasures (<em>terma</em>) within the mountains, caves and lakes of Tibet. So that future generations might gain faith and trust, the Lotus-Born left a body-imprint (<em>kurjÃ©</em>) in a cliff of stacked vajras in Bumthang;<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> he left footprints in places such as Drakmar in Paro; and he left handprints at the four great lakesâNamtso Chukmo and the others. These hand and footprints left by the Guru remain visible to the present day â testimony to his many inconceivable and marvellous deeds. Miraculously, there was nowhere in Tibet that he did not go â not even a single palm-sized scrap of land was left untrod. Thus he established places of accomplishment everywhere, to bestow great blessings on whoever might encounter them.</p>
<p>With manifestations beyond number, based on the capacity and inclination of beings, the Lotus-Born with his limitless deeds brought inconceivable benefit to beings in places such as Kashmir, China, Mongolia and Shangshung. In inconceivable ways he brought benefit to fortunate disciples, both those with physical form and those without, thereby pervading every dwelling place of gods, humans and nÄgas, as many as the grains of sand on this great earth. <em>The Secret Key Instructions for Accomplishing the Guru</em><a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as space itself extends,<br/>
Living beings there are found;<br/>
As far as karma and defilements last,<br/>
So too do my activities reach. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lotus-Born remained in Tibet for one hundred and eleven years. Then the master departed to vanquish the land of the raká¹£asas. So that the king, ministers and subjects would not object to his departure, the Lotus-Born bestowed his last testament and oral instructions to all his Tibetan disciples. He gave his vajra-promise that he would come every morning and evening to those with faith, and that on every tenth day of the waxing moon he would come to protect and guard the people of Tibet. </p>
<p>On the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, from the Gungthang Pass, amidst an inconceivable, enchanting, miraculous display, the Lotus-Born took his leave astride the supreme steedâhis destination the southwest, to subdue the raká¹£asas there. Gods and goddesses assembled in the sky, making boundless offerings and playing a multitude of music. Flowers rained from the sky and rainbows appeared. </p>
<p>There in the land of the raká¹£asas the Lotus-Born remains, assuming a special form in order to tame the beings there. He ceaselessly leads them to the Dharma by continuously turning the Dharma wheel, in manifold magical emanations that arouse the good at the heart of all beings. </p>
<p>It is clear that the Guru actually appeared, and thus it is impossible to deny his inconceivable, exalted deedsâhe, whose kindness will always pervade the three realms. </p>
<p>This was an extremely concise account of the precious Guruâs life and liberation. To read a more extensive account, please consult the Guruâs biographies as recounted in the <em>Pema Kathang</em><a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> and other texts.</p>
<h3>2. Introduction to the Great Festival, the Tenth Day</h3>
<p>In general the Tibetans have various traditions for determining the beginning of the year. It is a well-accepted tradition to start the year with MÄgha,<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> or the first lunar month. Nevertheless, according to the KÄlacakra traditions, the year begins with Caitra, or the third lunar month, and according to tantras such as <em>The Four Vajra-Chapters, The Conduct of the YoginÄ«s, The Ocean of á¸ÄkinÄ«s of the Cakrasaá¹vara, The Vajra Palace</em>,<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> and many others, the year begins with Pauá¹£a, or the twelfth lunar month. In former times in Tibet, they used to celebrate New Year during Pauá¹£a, or the twelfth lunar month. From as early as then, the tradition of determining the tenth day of the waxing and waning moon has been impartially accepted by one and all. In the tantras of the VajrayÄna, the tenth day of the waxing moon each month and the tenth day of the waning moon (or the twenty-fifth day) are explained to be special days. It was specifically on the tenth day of the waxing moon that the second Buddha of Uá¸á¸iyÄna displayed his vast and marvellous miraculous deeds of enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activitiesâthroughout the entire world and particularly in India and Tibet. Likewise, in his great love for us all, the Lotus-Born promised that it would be primarily on the tenth day of the waxing moon that the blessings of his exalted compassion would descend on the people of Tibetâs snowy land, as well as on all of us faithful disciples in need of his taming hand. </p>
<p><em>The Oral Instruction on the Secret Gathering of Secrets</em><a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon that day of days, the tenth day of the monkey month,<br/>
And each tenth day of every month,<br/>
Sending emanations, I shall fill the world,<br/>
Supreme and common siddhis richly to bestow.<br/>
If you spend your life accomplishing the Teacher,<br/>
When the time of dissolution comes,<br/>
Youâll melt into my heartâUá¸á¸iyÄna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Sampa LhundrupmaââThe Prayer to Guru Rinpoche that Spontaneously Fulfils all Wishesâ</em><a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, when this degenerate dark age reaches its final depths,<br/>
At dawn and dusk you come, for those who have devotion,<br/>
Riding on the rays of the rising and setting sunâ
And on the tenth day of the waxing moon you come in person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It says in the terma treasures of Ratna Lingpa:<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although I have gone to the land of the raká¹£asasâ
In each monkey year, on the tenth of the monkey month,<br/>
And on every tenth day, in each and every month<br/>
I will come back personallyâthis is a promise.<br/>
The Lotus-Born does not deceive other beings,<br/>
So be rid of your doubts, my followers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A promise made with the Lotus-Bornâs vajra-speech can never be deceiving. In <em>The Guide to Accomplishing the Guru</em>:<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth day of the monkey month, in the monkey year,<br/>
I of Uá¸á¸iyÄna will appear throughout Tibetâ<br/>
Of this be sureâit is my pledge and promise.<br/>
On every tenth day of the month Iâll come,<br/>
And with my emanations fill Tibet.<br/>
This is my sacred pledge.<br/>
The Lotus-Born does not have the power to deceive.<br/>
Fix your minds on me, all you who have devotion.<br/>
Make a torma like a blazing jewel, adorn it with an incense stick,<br/>
And call to me with music and the skull-drumâs sound.<br/>
Recite the prayer of seven lines, invoking me with fervent melody.<br/>
And from the hill of CÄmara, I of Uá¸á¸iyÄnaâ<br/>
Like a mother helpless to resist<br/>
The weeping of her darling childâ<br/>
Will come, my blessings to bestow.<br/>
This is my pledge, and hell awaits me should I fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lotus-Born made many undeceiving vajra-promises such as these. Since this was the manner of our precious Guruâs birthâin the wood-monkey year, on the tenth day of the monkey month, miraculously as a nirmÄá¹akÄya endowed with the 32 major and 80 minor marks on an isle in the Sindhu ocean, upon the anthers of a blossoming lotusâthe tenth day is an especially powerful time. It is said that if you make a vast feast-offering on that day, the merit that you will accumulate is a hundred thousand times more exalted than on any other day. Learned scholars have variously explained this monkey month to be the fifth, sixth or seventh month of the Tibetan year. However, it is the mind of the childish that seeks to disagree upon exactly when it was that the enlightened buddha activity of taming beings actually entered our world. There is actually no conflict in choosing any of the dates. The great awareness-holder JikmÃ© Lingpa said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sixth month, at sunrise on the tenth day,<br/>
He will appear from the lotus flower blossoming on DhanakoÅa. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, JikmÃ© Lingpa has identified the monkey month as the sixth Tibetan month. Nevertheless, there is no fault in choosing any of the other dates. The Cakrasaá¹vara root tantra states:<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, on the tenth day of the waxing moon and the tenth day of the waning moon (the twenty-fifth day), yoginÄ«s will come. Thus recognize this time as special and exalted. At these times, á¸ÄkinÄ«s will come to the outer sacred places, lands and charnel grounds. Internally, within the vajra-body, the <em>nÄá¸i</em>, <em>prÄá¹a</em> and <em>bindu</em> will gather, known as the âsubsidiary gatheringâ. This time is praised as supreme, when interdependent outer and inner circumstances for accomplishment come together â for the infinite activities of pacifying, increasing, magnetising and subjugating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lochen DharmaÅrÄ« said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth day of the waning moon (the twenty-fifth day), the á¸ÄkinÄ«s will gather in the outer sacred sites, and internally the <em>nÄá¸i</em>, <em>prÄá¹a</em> and <em>bindu</em> will gather. Thus this time is exalted. Particularly during the day on the tenth and at night on the twenty-fifth, accomplished á¸ÄkinÄ«s will gather in the places of practitioners. Therefore, whenever you begin an activity, strive to begin it on these days!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The omniscient Longchen Rabjam said:<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth of the waxing moon and the tenth of the waning moon, during the day and at night, strive in approach and accomplishment; offer the gaá¹acakra, fulfilment and confession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ngawang Rinchen said in his testament explaining the history of the northern treasures:<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Followers of my teachingsâ
If you wish for peace and happiness to come to Tibetâ
At sunrise on the tenth day of the waxing moon<br/>
An emanation of myself, Uá¸á¸iyÄna, will appear.<br/>
On that day, arouse devotion towards me;<br/>
At best, look at the natural state during your generation and perfection practices;<br/>
Establish the outer, inner and secret practices<br/>
With the excellent motivation of bodhicitta;<br/>
Make vast aspirations to create the karmic connection<br/>
To become a guide for the beings of the six realms.<br/>
Other than this, purify the obscurations of body, speech and mind<br/>
And strive in accumulating positive karma.<br/>
Help by propagating the Buddhaâs teachings and by building objects of worship.<br/>
Take the one-day lay vows, make <em>tsa-tsas</em>,<br/>
Set living creatures free, and recite ransom prayers.<br/>
Build bridges for people to cross dangerous paths safely.<br/>
Make offerings to the saá¹gha, make circumambulations,<br/>
And pray to me with devotion.<br/>
With whatever virtue you are personally drawn to, pray to me with devotion!<br/>
At the least, at sun rise on the tenth day<br/>
Do not engage in non-virtuous deeds, such as taking lives.<br/>
Give whatever you can to the disabled, to beggars, dogs and animalsâ<br/>
All those around your homeâand cultivate compassion.<br/>
In brief, on the tenth day of the waxing moon,<br/>
Whoever you are, wherever you may be,<br/>
Make offerings to the Buddha and assist sentient beings,<br/>
Reverently write out mantra syllables,<br/>
Or with compassion prepare and offer water bowls,<br/>
Perform activities such as these on the Lotus-Bornâs day!<br/>
On that day, because of my former aspirations,<br/>
Any merit will be multiplied a hundred thousand times<br/>
And my compassion will swiftly protect you.<br/>
My heart disciplesâ<br/>
If you wish for peace and happiness to come to Tibet,<br/>
Establish the excellent law of Dharma as the law of the land.<br/>
Through my example and liberation, you will be cared forâ<br/>
Whichever of the outer, inner and secret sÄdhanas you practice<br/>
For accomplishing the sÅ«tras, tantras, teachings and pith-instructions,<br/>
Leaving nothing out, and nothing added or misspelled.<br/>
If you follow this advice, you can rest in certaintyâ<br/>
Have no doubt that peace and happiness will come to Tibet!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great Fifth Dalai Lamaâs prayer, <em><a href="/tibetan-masters/fifth-dalai-lama/cloud-banks-of-blessings">Cloud-banks of Blessings</a></em>, recounts the deeds of the Guru:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During all activitiesâpractices, offerings, prayers and praises,<br/>
If your wisdom-being is invoked with unshakable devotion,<br/>
Then at sunrise on the excellent tenth day you will come!<br/>
This is your vajra-speech and your promise!</p>

In the generation stage<br/>
Of any sÄdhana whatsoeverâ<br/>
There I am before you.<br/>
When you make the maá¹á¸ala<br/>
And set out tormas and the substances of offering,<br/>
Do not doubt itâI will come to you.<br/>
I shall come, unable to resist,<br/>
When with devotion and strong, fervent prayers<br/>
You pray to me, the Lotus-Born of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
I will come to you. </p>

<p>And: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meditate on me, the Guru; accomplish me; follow me.<br/>
For seeing me is seeing all the buddhas.<br/>
And, because I am the very essence of all the sugatas,<br/>
On every tenth day I shall come to Tibet. </p>

<p>Therefore, remembering the Lotus-Bornâs life and liberation, make fervent prayers. </p>

<p>Ratna Lingpaâs terma <em>The Invocation of Uá¸á¸iyÄna on the Tenth Day</em><a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In brief, the ways I tame are beyond imagination,<br/>
For Uá¸á¸iyÄnaâs kindness is not slight, but vast!<br/>
Every realm shall have a most sacred place,<br/>
That will be a monument to Uá¸á¸iyÄna;<br/>
At every frontier there will be a treasure trove,<br/>
Likewise a monument to Uá¸á¸iyÄna. </p>

<p>And:<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And likewise it is said that the various rituals and practices for the subjugation of evil forces, which in every village are performed by monks or lay practitioners of Secret Mantraâthese too are memorials of the master of Uá¸á¸iyÄna. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text goes on to say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly told, my ways of benefit are past imagining,<br/>
And all shall be memorials to me, Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
In times to come, when people yearn for me<br/>
And think of me with longing love,<br/>
Behold, I shall be standing at their side.<br/>
And all who on the tenth day of the waxing moon<br/>
Recall and make remembrance of meâ<br/>
They and I shall never separate...<br/>
And yet for me, in truth, there is no coming or going.<br/>
You meet me when your karma and your obscurations<br/>
Are both cleansed.<br/>
According to the prayers and relative perceptions<br/>
Of the ones whom I might train,<br/>
I am indeed residing in the land of <em>raká¹£asas</em>.<br/>
And yet, because the stream of my compassion is unbroken,<br/>
I am present constantly to those with faith in me... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great Guru of Uá¸á¸iyÄna said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For anyone, man or woman, who has faith in me,<br/>
I, the Lotus Born, have never departedâI sleep on their threshold.<br/>
For me there is no death.<br/>
An emanation of myself, the Lotus-Born,<br/>
Will be present in front of each and every one with faith in me. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth chapter of <em>The Jeweled Treasury of the Oral Transmission</em>, discovered by Ratna Lingpa, says the following in the advice to YeshÃ© Tsogyal:<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From time to time, go to some pleasant place, a mountaintop or some lonely valley, and pray to me at the top of your voiceâso loudly you feel as if your very head might burst. Filled with devotion, allow a weariness of saá¹sÄra and a longing to be freed to flood into you until great tears well forth. This is a crucial instruction, since it will wash away a great many karmic obscurations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holding these, the Lotus-Bornâs unfailing vajra-promises, in your heart, make fervent prayers!</p>
<h3>3. Explanation of the Gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p>When we embark upon the profound path of skilful means, the Secret Mantra VajrayÄna, the special method that swiftly brings about the two accumulations is the gaá¹acakra.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> Within the gaá¹acakra a distinction of four gatherings is made.<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> These are explained in <em>The Stages of Vajra Activity</em>:<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is a gathering of friends, this is called âthe gathering of practitioners.â When all the components are present, this is explained as âthe gathering of blissful abundance.â When the deities and oath-bound protectors are gathered, this is explained as âthe gathering of the great assembly.â This ensures that the continuous perfection of the two accumulations will be recognized as âthe great gathering.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, if the assembledâthe gathering of practitionersâis made up of only skilful means (male) or only wisdom (female), then the gathering is called âthe feast of heroesâ or âthe feast of heroinesâ respectively. If both skilful means and wisdom are in attendance, then the gathering is called âthe gathering of fortunate ones.â Secondly, the gathering of components such as food, drink, clothes, ornaments, song and dance, and union and liberation, constitutes âthe gathering of abundant components.â Thirdly, setting up a representation of the wisdom maá¹á¸ala, both deities and palace, along with its guardians and meditation upon it as the basis of the siddhis, constitutes âthe gathering of delighted deities.â<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> Fourth is the continuity of the two accumulations, called âthe great gathering.â The gaá¹acakra of means, the applied conduct of the generation stage with appearancesâall this is the accumulation of merit. The completion stage of wisdom is the realization and familiarization of the entire profound assemblage as unbornâthis is the perfect accumulation of wisdom.</p>
<p>As feast substances, gather whatever you are able to acquire â in particular, the five meats and amá¹tas. This, in turn, means that meat and alcohol are indispensable feast substances. The <em>Heruka Galpo</em><a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> elaborates: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dorje tsÃ©, galchÃ©, jamdÃ©, datrom, jagat, tsetri, dzagÃ©, mÄá¹sa, trenmo, shamo, kuntugyÃ¼, amra, gÃ¼nbrum, agaru, nali, gegyÃ©,</em> and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we explain these secret terms, then <em>dorjÃ© tsÃ©</em> is dough<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a>, <em>galchÃ©</em> is a dough of flour mixed with rice beer, <em>jamdÃ©</em> is milk, <em>datrom</em> is butter and cheese, <em>jagad</em> is alcohol, <em>tsetri</em> are bitter tasting foods, <em>dzagÃ©</em> is curd and pies, <em>mÄá¹sa</em> is meat, <em>trenmo</em> are condiments,<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a> <em>shamo</em> are fruits, <em>kuntugyÃ¼</em> is salt, <em>amra</em> is human flesh, <em>gÃ¼nbrum</em> is elephant meat, <em>agaru</em> is horse meat, <em>nali</em> is cow meat, and <em>gegyÃ©</em> is dog meat. In essence, gather whatever food and drink you are able to acquire. Regarding the feast substances,<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a> the great AtiÅa said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Tibet no merit will come, because substances offered are so few!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it is said, to offer merely as much as you can eat is inappropriate. Thus, do not thoughtlessly set down just a single bag of food. Arrange the feast articles nicely on the hide of a carnivorous animal, or on a cloth painted to represent this. Place them in a <em>kÄpÄla</em> or other precious vessel. Place the food on the right of the shrine and the drinks on the left. Sprinkle the feast substances with clean water, for purification. With <em>raá¹</em>, <em>yaá¹</em> and <em>khaá¹</em>, all the habits of dualistic grasping at objects are burned, scattered and washed away, and the faults and defects of the offered substances are cleansed. Through the three syllables (<em>oá¹</em>, <em>Äá¸¥</em> and <em>hÅ«á¹</em>), the substances are purified and multiplied, and thereby consecrated to become heaps of sensual delights. Next, sprinkle the feast substances with <em>amá¹ta</em>. When you sprinkle the substances with scented water, imagine that from the scented water the gathering of wrathful ones emanates and expels all the obstacle makers. Moreover, with light radiating forth from yourself as the deity, imagine that all the sensual delights of all the world(s) are gathered up, dissolving into the feast substances. It is said that this is a key point.</p>
<p>Do not place as feast substances articles that are impure, improper or obtained through wrong livelihood and the like. Know what to adopt and what to abandon, and thus avoid mistakes such as eating before the feast has been offered, diminishing the remainder, and âfeast-wolf behaviourâ.<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a> The assembled pure samaya holdersâthe vajra-brothers and sistersâshould refrain from disrespectful behaviours such as joking, chatting and inattentiveness. Maintain âyogic conduct of awarenessâ, do a full or symbolic prostration,<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a> and take your seat. </p>
<p>Then, imagine the whole assembly of the deities of the maá¹á¸ala, together with the deities of the Three Roots, and the protectors, invited as guests from the buddha-fields of the ten directions, taking their seats in the sky in front, gathering like billowing clouds. It is explained in the <em>Heruka Galpo</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, offer the six sensual delights.<br/>
Second, make confession with the samaya substances, <em>amá¹ta</em>.<br/>
Third, serve the aggregates of enemies and obstacle makers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated, the feast-offering is divided into three portions. Elsewhere in the scriptures, the feast-offering is described as divided into four or five portions. Whatever scripture you follow, when you offer the first portion, visualize goddesses of sensual delights filling the whole of the sky and presenting cloud-banks of offerings in unimaginable array to the whole assembly of deities. And, as the assembled deities take delight in these offerings, imagine that the two accumulations are perfected.</p>
<p>For the second portion, the confession, imagine the samaya substances, such as the five meats and <em>amá¹tas</em>, to be in essence the nature of wisdom <em>amá¹ta</em>. Delighting in the offered substances, the deities are filled with love. As all defilements and breakages are confessed in their presence, all corruptions and degenerations of samaya, every deterioration, without exception, is purified. Thus, impairments<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a> in relation to the wisdom deities are restored.</p>
<p>For the third portion, the liberation offering, perform the liberation of the self through actualizing the view, the fortress of dharmatÄ; the meditation, the clearance of the pitfalls of samÄdhi; and the action, the life-force of compassion.<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a> It is explained in the tantras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great samaya of liberation through compassion<br/>
Is neither killing [out of anger] nor suppressing [out of ignorance].<br/>
My whole body is transformed into vajra-body<br/>
And my consciousness is transformed into vajra, [its true nature].<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated, the person performing the liberation ritual should be a holder of all the profound key-points of realization and conduct: </p>
<ul>
<li>being entirely motivated by great bodhicitta,</li>
<li>having the capacity to liberate others through compassion<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a></li>
<li>being stable, powerful and focused<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Such a person then liberates his enemies, those wicked evildoers who have committed the seven violations<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a> and who thereby show all ten grounds.<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a> He liberates them through profound methods of fierce and wrathful subjugation. Once liberated, their consciousness is sent to the Akaniá¹£á¹­ha heaven, by means of entering the place of union of the Victorious Lord and Lady. Then such beings take rebirth as sons and daughters of the awakened family. This is what is called âcaring for othersâ through the skilful means of Secret Mantra. Since sharing the full meaning of this would make the text too complex, I shall not elaborate further.</p>
<p>In the case of a simple feast-offering, the procedure for the third portion is as follows. Having summoned the enemies and obstacle makers and having bound, shackled and intoxicated them, imagine that the wrathful deities who âsend the consciousnessâ enjoy the third portion as the samaya of âvajra foodâ. Thus sprinkle it with amá¹ta, and offer the third portion. </p>
<p>The first, confession and liberation portions are blessed with amá¹ta and then offered to the torma. If this is inconvenient, you can also âsymbolically offer the portionsâ<a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a> and arrange them in order, in front of you, as best you can. There are various traditions for âoffering the fulfilmentâ<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a> and, as is often done, it is acceptable for this to follow on from the liberation offering. Sprinkle the fulfilment offering with amá¹ta, visualize the general guests such as the protectors of the pure abodes, and present the fulfilment offering in a clean place outside. It is said that any of the infinite activitiesâsuch as giving empowerments, or consecration (<em>rabnÃ©</em>) or fire-offering (<em>jinsek</em>) ritualsâcan be inserted at this point.</p>
<p>Next, the ritual assistant puts a feast portion aside. Having paid homage, and with arms crossed,<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a> he says, âPlease enjoy this feast offering!â and so forth.<a href="#fn:60" id="fnref:60" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[60]</a> With this, he or she offers the feast to the vajra-master. In turn, the vajra-master performs the lotus mudrÄ and takes the feast with the three-pointed mudrÄ. The ritual assistant(s) then distribute(s) the feast to the entire assembly, starting from the beginning of the rows. The vajra-master and students set aside mindless behaviour and maintain the three maá¹á¸alas,<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a> reciting together: âThe aggregates, elements and sense organs of my body... .â<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a> Visualize the deities of the maá¹á¸ala of the hundred deities,<a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a> the sacred essence of the three seats of completeness of the aggregates, elements and sense fields.<a href="#fn:64" id="fnref:64" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[64]</a> Bring to mind the recollection of purity of the vajra-body. Recognizing the five fingers of your hands to be the five goddesses of sensual delights, take hold of the food and drink, visualizing it either as the amá¹ta of bliss and emptiness (according to the path of method) or as untainted wisdom amá¹ta (according to the path of liberation) offer the feast so that it fulfils the six satisfactions<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a> and delight in and enjoying the offerings. Then recite aspiration prayers, such as: âBy making this feast offering, to the city of Glorious Herukas...â<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a> As for the samaya substances of the feast, do not despise or look down on them, merely accepting some and rejecting others. Avoid the eight infractions<a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a> such as quarrelling, making noises, or joking. </p>
<p>The points of the six satisfactions, as given by Jikme Lingpa, are: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>to satisfy the deities of the field of accumulation, with offerings,</li>
<li>to satisfy the yogins, with vajra-foods and drinks,</li>
<li>to satisfy the wisdom maá¹á¸ala, with the essence of amá¹ta,</li>
<li>to satisfy the deities of the body maá¹á¸ala, with the wisdom of bliss and emptiness,</li>
<li>to satisfy the outer and inner á¸ÄkinÄ«s, with song,</li>
<li>to satisfy the haughty spirits and their retinues, with the torma.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While remaining untainted by hope and fear, by thoughts of clinging to pure and impure, bring to mind that all appearance and existence is the display of infinite purity, and has always been soâthroughout beginningless time. Thus take the feast-offerings of the sensual delights as siddhis, and enjoy them. Visualize your aggregates, elements and sense organs as the male and female deities, and satisfy them with the white and red amá¹ta of the essences of the channels. Imagine the delight of the entire gathering of deities of the maá¹á¸ala of the body. This then constitutes the outer gaá¹acakra of sensual delights. Imagine all the yogins and yoginÄ«s to be in nature the iá¹£á¹­adevatÄs, á¸ÄkinÄ«s, vÄ«ras, and vÄ«rÄs. Then, by means of the blessing of the secret space, and the descending and ascending energy of union, ascertain the wisdom of the four joys. This constitutes the inner gaá¹acakra. The secret gaá¹acakra is to rest, without altering or fabricating, within the essence of the self-abiding natural state, the sphere of primordial wisdom of great bliss, free from all elaborations.</p>
<p>If you wish to perform vajra songs and dance, <em>The Garland of Pearls</em> has this to say:<a href="#fn:68" id="fnref:68" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[68]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the gaá¹acakra, receiving empowerments and entering the maá¹á¸ala,
Diligently perform and offer songs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated, while applying yourself to the ocean of realization and conduct of the inconceivable dharmatÄ, diligently engage in vajra songs and dance! The excellent benefits of vajra song and dance are described in <em>The Union of the Sun and Moon</em>:<a href="#fn:69" id="fnref:69" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[69]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The immaculate vajra song<br/>
Satisfies the minds of all the buddhas,<br/>
Aids the experience of the yogins,<br/>
Captivates the minds of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
Averts cravings for saá¹sÄra in the six classes of beings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like this, the tantra speaks of the benefits extensively. </p>
<p>Next, the whole assembly, with no trace of stinginess, gives leftover food â which is collected, beginning from the ends of the rows. During an accomplishment practice,<a href="#fn:70" id="fnref:70" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[70]</a> this leftover food, the remainder, is kept âimprisonedâ for the duration of the practice. Then, for the accomplishment of âswift activity,â the remainder is placed at the north-eastern border of the maá¹á¸ala. As stated in the <em>Heruka Galpo</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the maá¹á¸ala of the remainder at the north-eastern border,<br/>
Draw with rakta Eâs or crescents upon a violatorâs skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in the maá¹á¸alas in the north-east and south-west, draw for the peaceful activities a circular maá¹á¸ala with scented water, and for the wrathful activities, upon a violatorâs skin<a href="#fn:71" id="fnref:71" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[71]</a>, a <em>dharmodaya</em>, source of phenomena,<a href="#fn:72" id="fnref:72" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[72]</a> and a crescent. During a one-day practice, the pure and impure remainder are placed one above the other<a href="#fn:73" id="fnref:73" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[73]</a> and then blessed and consecrated. The pure remainder is offered to the seven higher ranks, while the impure remainder from the yogins is offered to the seven lower ranks. Visualize within the infinite dark-blue triangle at the periphery, the remainder maá¹á¸alaâa palace with doors, the gathering of peaceful and wrathful deities, the sacred lands and places, the guests of the seven higher ranks and the seven lower ranksâsuch as the <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>, <em>kiá¹karas</em>, and <em>rÄká¹£asas</em>. By whistling, you call and invite them. Thus, imagine that they come and gather within the triangle at the periphery, like crows landing on a plain, and recite:<a href="#fn:74" id="fnref:74" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[74]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>âFirst, offer the best portion.â<a href="#fn:75" id="fnref:75" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[75]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the best portion belongs to the gathering of peaceful and wrathful deities, it is to be offered to the guests of the seven higher ranks, first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âSecond, enjoy the two inseparable as one.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assembly of <em>mÄtá¹kÄs</em> and <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em> enjoy it with them.<a href="#fn:76" id="fnref:76" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[76]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>âThird, satisfy the guests with the remainder.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, offer the remainder to its respective ownersâthe guests of the seven lower ranks, such as the <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>, <em>kiá¹karas</em> and <em>rÄká¹£asas</em>. For this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âBless the remainder with spit.â<a href="#fn:77" id="fnref:77" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[77]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this means, the samaya with the respectful owners of the remainder, such as the <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>, <em>kiá¹karas</em> and <em>rÄká¹£asas</em> is mixed as one.<a href="#fn:78" id="fnref:78" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[78]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>âThus there is a division into three parts.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the way things work in the mundane world, there is a great difference between the lord and the subjects.<a href="#fn:79" id="fnref:79" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[79]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âFinally, mix it inseparable as one.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the peaceful, enriching or magnetising activity, place it below. For wrathful activity, place it on top.<a href="#fn:80" id="fnref:80" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[80]</a></p>
<p>Dedicate the practice according to the tradition of our sacred forefathers. At night and in order to protect from a âdirect encounterâ,<a href="#fn:81" id="fnref:81" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[81]</a> place a burning lamp in the remainder. The ritual assistant wearing the ceremonial hat goes outside and carries the remainder seventy steps away from the shrine room. This is called the âfeeding pathway of the raká¹£asas.â There, the ritual assistant places the remainder on an offering plate. </p>
<p>Beings of the seven higher ranks, according to the <em>Heruka Galpo</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) those called-upon from all-encompassing space<br/>
2) those who hold authentic blessings<br/>
3) the great method revealed as male<br/>
4) the great wisdom revealed as female<br/>
5) the eight wrathful <em>gaurÄ«s</em><br/>
6) the great <em>piÅacÄ«s</em> of the lands<br/>
7) the four female wisdom gate-keepers </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These constitute the maá¹á¸ala of those of the seven higher ranks.</p>
<p>Beings of the seven lower ranks: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) The thirty-two magical <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>,<br/>
2) The eight great <em>kiá¹karas</em> who delight in union and liberation<br/>
3) The three <em>rÄká¹£asas</em> who offer the extent of their realization<br/>
4) The eight <em>jvÄlas</em> who inflict harm on body, speech and mind<br/>
5) The <em>mÄras</em>, the <em>rÄká¹£asas</em>, the seven <em>mÄtá¹kÄs</em> and the four <em>bhaginÄ«s</em><br/>
6) The sixty-four <em>dÅ«tÄ«s</em> of the sacred places </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the six that own the impure remainder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7) The twenty-eight who own both the pure and impure remainder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On special occasions, when you wish to accumulate a hundred feast-offerings, after completing the elaborate gaá¹acakra sÄdhana liturgy, you should repeat the section that begins with the blessing and continue until concluding with the remainder. One recitation of this part is counted as one accumulation. According to the Mindroling tradition, a symbolic offering is made to the vajra-master after each accumulation, and a part of this offering to him is also symbolically dedicated as the remainder. Finally, after the ritual has been completed, the guests of the feast simultaneously depart or dissolve.</p>
<h3>4. Teaching the Excellent Benefits of Offering the Gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p><em>The Vajra-Net</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst the accumulations of merit, the gaá¹acakra is supreme.<br/>
All wishes of this life will be accomplished,<br/>
Negative forces and obstacles will be pacified.<br/>
In the next, in the realm of the victorious vidyÄdharas,<br/>
One will reach the level of Samantabhadra. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it is said:<a href="#fn:82" id="fnref:82" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[82]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The faults of the transgressions of samaya will be dispelled.<br/>
Everything unfavourable will be defeated.<br/>
One will accomplish whatever one desires.<br/>
One will gather and accumulate virtue.<br/>
All the food of the feast will bestow siddhis.<br/>
The deities and spirits of the remainder will be satisfied.<br/>
Performing the ritual of the gaá¹acakra<br/>
Will swiftly grant the siddhi of mahÄmudrÄ â its prophecy and attainment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, therefore, practitioners will by this means perfect the two accumulations and restore all impairments and breakages of samaya. Thus does one join the ranks of the herukas. </p>
<p>YeshÃ© Tsogyal said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By gathering the gaá¹acakra<br/>
And through merely a single gaá¹acakra,<br/>
The lower realms will be closed to you<br/>
And you will never again return and take birth as a human.<br/>
Understand that this is certainly proven! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, YeshÃ© Tsogyal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth day of the waxing moon and the tenth day of its waning,<br/>
On the eight day and the fifteenth,<a href="#fn:83" id="fnref:83" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[83]</a><br/>
Gather the gaá¹acakra and make offerings.<br/>
Offering the gaá¹acakra merely once will close the doors to the lower realms,<br/>
And you will never return and take birth as a human again.<br/>
Understand that this can be established with certainty, through logic. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The victorious Longchen Rabjam said:<a href="#fn:84" id="fnref:84" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[84]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst all conditioned virtue, there is no merit greater than gathering the profound gaá¹acakra.<br/>
Its excellent benefits are as follows:<br/>
It perfects the accumulations of merit and wisdom.<br/>
It restores all transgressions of samaya.<br/>
Assemblies of á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s will gather in the places of the practitioners and will accomplish the activities.<br/>
The masters and the gathering of the deities of the maá¹á¸ala will be delighted.<br/>
The ocean of samaya-bound guardians will guard and protect you.<br/>
Your present life will be long, free from disease.<br/>
You will enjoy renown and numerous enjoyments and helpers.<br/>
Whatever you wish for will be effortlessly and instantly accomplished.<br/>
The supreme and ordinary siddhis will be attained.<br/>
All obstacles and negativities will be purified<br/>
And in a future life you will gain unsurpassable awakening.<br/>
Like this, you will attain inconceivable and unutterable qualities!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YeshÃ© Tsogyal said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth day of the waxing moon and the tenth day of its waning (the twenty-fifth day of the lunar month),<br/>
If you pray with fervent devotion from the depths of your heart<br/>
To Orgyen TsokyÃ© Dorje, the Lake-born Vajra of Uá¸á¸iyÄna,<br/>
With his retinue of á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
And if you generate bodhicittaâ<br/>
Vast heart of the awakened mind for the benefit of beings,<br/>
If you strive in offering the gaá¹acakra wherever you may beâ
In whatever land, place, great sacred site, monastery, or cityâ
You will reap benefits and results defying the imagination.<br/>
In all lands and all places, crime will be averted, as will famine, war, evil, and unfavourable circumstances.<br/>
Rain will fall on time, harvests will be abundant, and auspiciousness will prevail throughout the land.<br/>
If you offer the gaá¹acakra every month without interruption, the obstacles to your life will be pacified and whatever you wish for will be spontaneously fulfilled.<br/>
Material possessions, food and wealth will effortlessly come to you.<br/>
If you offer the gaá¹acakra a hundred or a thousand times, you will take rebirth as a king with the power to transform the entire world.<br/>
If you offer the gaá¹acakra ten thousand or a hundred thousand times, you will become a universal monarch with dominion over multiple world systems.<br/>
If you offer the gaá¹acakra a million times, you will bring the three realms under your control; your glory and splendor will outshine the three plains of existence; you will accomplish without difficulty the four activities; and in your next life you will take rebirth in the buddhafield of Lotus Light, amidst vidyÄdharas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s, where you will receive the nectar-like speech of Guru Rinpoche. Thus blessed, you will be able to benefit beings in infinite ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever strives in practicing the gaá¹acakra<br/>
Will reach, in the future, the pure stages of the vidyÄdharas<br/>
In the realm of Lotus Light.<br/>
There is no doubt â they will not return to saá¹sÄra! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Guruâs Jewel Ocean</em> by Pema Lingpa<a href="#fn:85" id="fnref:85" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[85]</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we link the excellent benefits of practicing on the tenth day to the supreme siddhis of the four vidyÄdhara stages, then:<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the tiger month will lead you to attain the mahÄmudrÄ vidyÄdhara;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the snake month will lead you to attain the vidyÄdhara with power over life;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the monkey month will lead you to attain the spontaneously accomplished vidyÄdhara;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the pig month will lead you to attain the matured vidyÄdhara.<br/>
Or, if we link the excellent benefits to the ordinary siddhis of the accomplishment of the four activities, then:<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the rabbit month will lead you to accomplish the pacifying activity;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the horse month will lead you to accomplish the enriching activity;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the bird month will lead you to accomplish the magnetizing activity;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the rat month will lead you to accomplish the subjugating activity;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the dragon month, will mean all illnesses, negative forces and obstacles will be pacified;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the sheep month will mean life-span and merit will increase, and wealth and enjoyments abound;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the dog month will mean whatever you wish for will effortlessly come to be;<br/>
Offering a gaá¹acakra on the tenth day of the ox month will mean all harm from unfavourable circumstances, enemies and obstacles will be pacified. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same benefits apply to the tenth day of the waning moon (the twenty-fifth day) of every month. The blessing that comes with gathering the gaá¹acakra on every tenth and twenty-fifth day of every month will purify, without exception, all negativity and evil accumulated with body, speech and mind, and will guarantee that we become, in future lives, a buddha. Inconceivable and unutterable benefits such as these will be ours. </p>
<p>Thus it is perfectly logical that weâfollowers of the embodiment of all the victorious ones, the second buddha, the great master from Uá¸á¸iyÄna, the MahÄguru PadmÄkaraâand all holders of the Ngagyur Nyingma tradition, and each and every being of all classes and families having faith and devotion put effort into making offerings, wherever we are on the tenth day. </p>
<p><em>This text, A Bouquet of Uá¸umbara Flowers: An Explanation of the Significance of the Tenth Day and its Practice, was requested by my American students. Thus I, Rigdzin TrinlÃ© Ãzer, often called the vidyÄ-mantra holder GÃ¶npo Tseten, wrote it at the YeshÃ© Nyingpo Dharma centre in the area of California in America. Through it, may the minds of all sentient beings enter the virtuous path, and may excellent virtue increase ever further â like the waxing moon.</em><br/>

<p>The vajra-masterâs samÄdhi, or meditative concentration, must have the power to be able to fulfil the three satisfactions (<em>'tsheng pa gsum</em>). This implies that 1. the being liberated is satisfied since its mind is liberated into the <em>dharmadhÄtu</em>; 2. the deities are satisfied upon receiving the flesh and blood that has been transformed into wisdom nectar; and 3. the vajra-master performing the ritual is satisfied, since as a result of the ritual his or her life force increases.

Rinpoche provides a commentary for the following lines: dangpo pÃ¼ kyi mi chÃ¶ gyu/ bardu nyimÃ© chik tu mi rol gyu/ tama lhakmÃ© mi kang gyu/ lhakma khachÃ¼ mi dren gyu/ detar rimpa sum du mi yÃ© gyu/ tar nyimÃ© chik tu mi sÃ© gyu.
