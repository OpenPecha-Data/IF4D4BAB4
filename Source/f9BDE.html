	<h2>A Concise Explanation of Gaá¹acakra</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Adzom Gyalse Gyurme Dorje</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Great universal lord, embodiment of all the families,</em><br/>
<em>Glorious teacher, at your feet I bow!</em> </p>
<p>Here, I shall give a concise explanation of the marvellous gaá¹acakra, a method for quickly reaching the fruit of the two accumulations on the basis of the profound and swift path of the secret mantra VajrayÄna. When gathering the <em>gaá¹acakra</em>,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> all <em>yogins</em>, who have the <em>cause</em> characterized as knowing, the fortress of the <em>view</em>, and the <em>condition</em> characterized as engagement, the clearance of the pitfalls of cultivating <em>samÄdhi</em>, and are skilled in <em>means</em>, the friend or life-force of the <em>action</em>, should enter the gaá¹acakraâthe secret conductâin order to achieve transcendence.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> Yogins should thus strive in gaá¹acakra one-pointedly for a multitude of purposes such as actualizing the result. As the omniscient DrimÃ© Ãzer<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On full moon and new moon, the 8th and the 29th,<br/>
On the 10th of the waxing moon and the 10th of the waning moon, at day and at night,<br/>
Strive in approach and accomplishment; offer the feast, fulfilment and confession.<br/>
Wholeheartedly apply the profound key points of<br/>
The yogas such as the winds, mind, channels, and <em>bindus</em>.<br/>
Meditating thus on the path of the union of bliss, clarity and non-thought,<br/>
One will become a vajradhara and attain perfect buddhahood, within this life-time.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An overview of gaá¹acakra: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>its essence</li>
<li>its literal meaning</li>
<li>its divisions</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>1. Essence of Gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p>The essence is the perfection of the two accumulations and the bringing of delight and fulfilment to the deities, the teacher and the vajra-brothers and sisters.</p>
<h3>2. Literal Meaning of Gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p>The word <em>gaá¹a</em> means gathering. The <em>All-Illuminating</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gathering of the supported (delighted deities), individuals (fortunate disciples), the substances (abundant feast) and great method (excellent <em>samÄdhi</em>) is called a secret gathering.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Divisions of Gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p>Regarding its divisions, the <em>Four Seats</em><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An assembly of friends is called a <em>gaá¹a</em>.<br/>
By eliminating conceptual thoughts, the <em>cakra</em> is expressed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divisions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) outer,<br/>
b) inner,<br/>
c) secret, and<br/>
d) suchness gaá¹acakra. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>a) Outer Gaá¹acakra</h4>
<p>The outer gaá¹acakra is the accumulation of the feast substances constituting a diversity of sensory delights.</p>
<h4>b) Inner Gaá¹acakra</h4>
<p>The inner gaá¹acakra refers to a gathering of method and wisdom âÂ that is, of vajra brothers and sisters âÂ in equal number, or in a number that matches the number of deities, or as a large gathering. The <em>Secret Tantra</em><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the small assembly there are two, six or ten;<br/>
For the middling, the number of deities in the <em>maá¹á¸ala</em>;<br/>
And for the great, even more. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small gathering comprises the principal male and female; three pairs [six practitioners] symbolizing enlightened body, speech and mind or five pairs [ten practitioners] representing the five families. In this way there can be two, six or ten practitioners. For a middling assembly, the number of practitioners equals the number of deities in the <em>maá¹á¸ala</em>. For a great assembly, there will be even more practitioners. For these gatherings, pure samaya amongst the practitioners is of vital importance.</p>
<h4>c) Secret Gaá¹acakra</h4>
<p>The secret gaá¹acakra is the offering of the inner feast, with the blazing and dripping,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> using method and liberationâthe creation and completion practicesâto the deities of the three seats of completeness<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> in the city of the vajra-aggregates, oneâs own body. </p>
<h4>d) Innermost Gaá¹acakra of Suchness</h4>
<p><em>The secret and innermost gaá¹acakra</em>, is to take wisdom as the path and transcend the fabrications of an offering and an offerer. These practices belong to the later completion stages and should be studied by listening to the nectar-like speech of a master who holds the lineage. Through them the practitioner gains certainty and brings into experience the oral instructions that are given according to an individualâs disposition and capacity. </p>
<p>Now, so as to explain primarily the intent of the first two, <em>the outer and the inner gaá¹acakra</em>, there is the preparation, the main part and the conclusion:</p>
<h3>I. Preparation</h3>
<p>The preparation entails eight branches that should be applied]:</p>
<h4>1) The Branch of the Secluded Places</h4>
<p>gaá¹acakra should be offered in a place that holds the blessings of the buddhas, <em>vidyÄdharas</em> or bodhisattvas of the past. Or it should be practiced in a sacred place in which <em>á¸Äkas</em> and <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em> assemble, or a place which increases the power of <em>samÄdhi</em>, experience and realization, such as in the midst of rocky, snow or forest-covered mountains, pleasure groves, or places secluded from worldly distractions.</p>
<h4>2) The Branch of the Occasion</h4>
<p>In such a sacred place, gaá¹acakra should be offered in an auspicious year or on an auspicious month or day or when there is an important event, such as <em>rabnÃ©</em> rituals,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> <em>homa</em> offerings,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> the approach and accomplishment practices, initiations, festivals, or thanksgiving ceremonies.</p>
<h4>3) The Branch of the Support, the Individuals</h4>
<p>The individuals offering gaá¹acakra should include a vajra-master who has accomplished the practices of approach and accomplishment and has experience and realization, together with an assembly of vajra-brother and sisters holding the samayas and vows.</p>
<h4>4) The Branch of Conducive Friends</h4>
<p>The practitionersâ view and conduct has to be in accord with the development and completion stages of the deity.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
<h4>5) The Branch of the Deities to Be Accomplished</h4>
<p>This entails taking as the support the maá¹á¸alas of the unsurpassed tantras which are more exalted than the kriyÄ-action tantras.</p>
<h4>6) The Branch of Skilful Activity</h4>
<p>Here, there are six instructions to be followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Do not perform the ritual of gaá¹acakra before having requested and received permission to do so.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a><br/>
2) Do not offer gaá¹acakra before having performed the offering <em>mudrÄ</em>.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a><br/>
3) Do not perform the liberation offering before the first portion has been offered.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
4) Do not make offerings to the <em>yogins</em> and <em>yoginÄ«s</em> until the heaps have been arranged.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
5) Do not perform the activity, praise and invocation before having offered songs and dance.<br/>
6) The yogins and <em>yoginÄ«s</em> should not get up and leave before having offered the remainder. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>7) The Branch of Vows and Pledges</h4>
<p>The root and branch samayas of the practitioners have to be undefiled.</p>
<h4>8) The Branch of the Fruit to Be Attained</h4>
<p>The fruit to be attained is the experience of the inexhaustible adornments of the enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activity.</p>
<h3>II. The Main Part</h3>
<p><em>The Stages of Vajra Activity</em><a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is a gathering of friends, this is called âthe gathering of practitionersâ. When all the ingredients are present, this is explained as âthe gathering of blissful abundanceâ. When the deities and dharma protectors are gathered, this is explained to be âthe gathering of the great assemblyâ. This then ensures that the continuous perfection of the two accumulations will be recognized as âthe great gatheringâ. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, as stated, there are four points to be applied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) The gathering of fortunate ones<br/>
2) The gathering of wealth and abundance<br/>
3) The gathering of delighted deities, and<br/>
4) The gathering of excellent <em>samÄdhi</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>1) The Gathering of Fortunate Ones</h4>
<p>The assembled vajra-brothers and sisters constitute âthe gathering of fortunate onesâ. If a gathering of only men assembles, it is âa feast of heroesâ. If a gathering of only women assembles, it is âa feast of the heroinesâ. If both heroes and heroines assemble, it is âa feast of method and wisdomâ. If there are only yogins assembled, it is âa feast of yoginsâ. Generally, it is explained that when both vajra-brothers and vajra-sisters assemble it is called âthe gaá¹acakraâ. Although this is the case, it is nonetheless crucial to check if it is appropriate to offer gaá¹acakra or not. If there are breaches and violations of the samayas between the master and vajra-brothers and sisters, or if the secret conduct<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> is beyond someoneâs scope, or the participants cling to pure and impure and the like, then it is inappropriate to offer gaá¹acakra. It is thus important to understand what is to be adopted and what is to be avoided.</p>
<h4>2) The Gathering of Wealth and Abundance</h4>
<p>In the past, when the yogins and yoginÄ«s gathered the gaá¹acakra in sacred places, in India and elsewhere, the feast substances and articles were worth five hundred <em>sang</em><a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> of gold, or at least ten sang's worth. Hence, it is important that the feast should be a magnificent arrangement of valuable, excellent and pure substances. It is stated in the tantras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentials such as <em>dawa</em>,<br/>
Excellent tastes such as <em>mÄá¹sa</em>,<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a><br/>
Flowers, sandalwood <em>mÄlÄs</em> and more,<br/>
Please accept all these excellent offerings! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, the yoginsâ view and meditation must be in accord with the feast substances. This is stated in the <em>Tantra of the Arising of Amá¹ta</em>:<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NÄgas and brahmins eat clean food.<br/>
That they will be liberated, this I have not explained.<br/>
Dogs, pigs and untouchables, eat unclean food.<br/>
That they will be liberated, this I have not explained.<br/>
Therefore, listen to this scripture of definitive meaning!<br/>
Skilled yogins<br/>
Experience the nature of the distinct five families as the single dharmakÄya.<br/>
Realizing this, one will be liberated. This I have explained. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes it clear that it is crucial for the yoginsâ view and conduct to be in harmony.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> Thus, when giving offerings to a large assembly, it should be <em>caru</em> foods.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> Likewise, the offerings for a <em>rabnÃ©</em> ritual should be <em>caru</em>, so should not include impure substances such as meat, alcohol, garlic and onions. However, when practicing gaá¹acakra, the indispensable substances of method and wisdom are meat and alcohol. As for the meat, unless the animal suffered for a long time from sickness or famine, or was liberated and guided by a qualified master, it is impermissible for the meat that is offered to come from an animal killed specifically for the gaá¹acakra. It is best to buy âmeat that could not be sold nine timesâ<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> or else one should buy âmeat of the three puritiesâ.<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> As for alcohol, unless an individual has reached the stage of heat<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> and is thus able to purify and transform the alcohol, it is not permitted to drink such a quantity of alcohol that oneâs mindfulness is impaired. Therefore, only use a very small amount of substances such as meat and alcohol. Furthermore, offerings may include solids and liquids such as: <em>dagyÃ©</em> (curd and pies), <em>datrom</em> (confection),<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> <em>tsegal</em> (ritual cakes made from a dough of flour mixed with rice beer and sweets), <em>mÄá¹sa</em> (meat), <em>kuntugyÃ¼</em> (salts), <em>jamdÃ©</em> (condiments),<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> various fruits, <em>dzagÃ©</em> (alcohol), <em>kang</em> (bone marrow), <em>ladu</em> (vegetables), and <em>yochen</em> (garlic).<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> Arrange whatever substances you can acquire without judging them as either pure or impure. Except where they serve as enhancement for the âall-victorious conductâ of supreme yogins, it is stated that it is inappropriate to add the âwolf substancesâ, such as offerings made by âsamaya breakersâ and 'brought by widows.' <a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a> This gathering of whatever sensory delights one can acquire constitutes what is called the outer gaá¹acakra. </p>
<p>Regarding the musical instruments, it is important to use those that correlate to the activity performed: for example, conches for peaceful practices, long trumpets for enriching, shawms for magnetizing and bone trumpets as well as the supreme skull drum for wrathful practices. </p>
<p>When offering gaá¹acakra, arrange any sensual delights, such as gold, silver or silk, without any stinginess or attachment. However, even if the offerings are small, like those of a <em>kuÅalin</em>,<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> it is the visualization and meditation that are most important. Thus, it is stated that it is sufficient to use the seasonal fruits and vegetables<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> as food and clean water as drink. </p>
<h4>3) The Gathering of Delighted Deities</h4>
<p>The gathering of delighted deities is the maá¹á¸ala of whichever deities of the three roots one relies upon.</p>
<h4>4) The Gathering of Excellent SamÄdhi</h4>
<p>Each phase of the ritual should always be accompanied by the <em>Four Gates of the Secret Mantra Scripture</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) practicing clearly the generation phase is the gate of the wordsâ meaning,<br/>
2) invoking the <em>iá¹£á¹­adevatÄ(s)</em> is the gate of secret mantra,<br/>
3) focusing one-pointedly is the gate of <em>samÄdhi</em>, and<br/>
4) using secret signs and symbols is the gate of <em>mudrÄ</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is crucial to recollect the purity of deity, mantra, <em>samÄdhi</em> and <em>mudrÄ</em>.<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> Hence, the great Guru of Uá¸á¸iyÄna stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever activity, offering or recitation is performed,<br/>
Non-distracted, with stable <em>samÄdhi</em>,<br/>
Do not just utter the secret mantraâs words like shamans! Evoke the wordsâ meaning!<br/>
For practicing without <em>samÄdhi</em> is to be like a barking dog.<br/>
Even though temporarily it might seem like practice, if without meaning it is like aimlessly wandering about.<br/>
Thus practice with a proper posture, speech that is silent, and a mind that is free from discursive thought!<br/>
Thus, as it is said, an undistracted visualization is of utmost importance. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Blessing the Feast</h4>
<p>There are various ways to bless the feast, but in general one places the substancesâthe delightful foods and drinks that were especially prepared for the gaá¹acakraâwithin the feast receptacles, the <em>kapÄla(s)</em> or vast lustrous vessel(s). Then, visualizing oneself as the deity, from the syllables <em>raá¹</em>, <em>yaá¹</em> and <em>kaá¹</em> in oneâs heart, light shoots forth which transforms into fire, wind and water. The fire of wisdom burns away all grasping at the feast offering as entities; the wind of clear seeing (<em>vipaÅyanÄ</em>) scatters all grasping thoughts; and the water of calm abiding (<em>Åamatha</em>) washes away all remaining subtle stains of dualistic grasping. The feast substances are purified into emptiness. Again, they arise vividly as the samaya substances of the five meats, five amá¹tas, immeasurable enjoyments and sensual delights. Then from the syllables <em>oá¹</em>, <em>Äá¸¥</em> and <em>hÅ«á¹</em> in oneâs heart, there shoots forth white, red and blue light which dissolves into the substances. Imagine that immeasurable syllables of <em>oá¹</em>, <em>Äá¸¥</em> and <em>hÅ«á¹</em> fill the feast substances. From them light radiates out, inviting the infinite <em>jÃ±ÄnÄmá¹ta</em>, which dissolves into, and becomes inseparable from, the <em>samayÄmá¹ta</em>. Imagine that the seed syllables also dissolve into light. In this way, the untainted wisdom of samaya and jÃ±Äna, united becomes great cloud-banks of sensual delights.</p>
<h4>Inviting the Deities to the Feast</h4>
<p>According to some ritual traditions, there are the following six maá¹á¸alas: the maá¹á¸ala of the field of accumulation, the maá¹á¸ala of the blazing periphery,<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a> the maá¹á¸ala of restoring the breakages and impairments, the maá¹á¸ala of the samaya of the generation phase, the maá¹á¸ala of natural wisdom and the maá¹á¸ala of the delightful gaá¹acakra. From among them, here we are considering the maá¹á¸ala of the delightful gaá¹acakra.</p>
<p>Either from both the front-visualization and self-visualization or from oneâs heart, inconceivable light rays shoot forth inviting all the deities residing in the infinite buddha-fields of the victorsâ three kÄyas<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a>âthe gurus, iá¹£á¹­adevatÄs, á¸ÄkinÄ«s, dharmapÄlas, wealth deities and treasure guardiansâto take their seats in the space in front and join the feast as our guests.</p>
<h4>First Portion of the Feast</h4>
<p>Imagine that goddesses of sensual delights are sent out, filling the whole sky. They all carry in their hands lustrous vessels made of various jewels, all filled with food and drink. Then, imagine that as many offering substances as there are in the realms of gods and humans, and as many unique offerings as there are, sprung forth through the aspirations of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, come to join this feast and are offered as cloud-banks of excellent offerings to the deities of the maá¹á¸ala. The gathered deities, extremely pleased and delighted, grant supreme and ordinary siddhis. Other texts explain that, in the manner of deities dissolving into other deities, the offering goddesses dissolve into the deitiesâ bodies. Thus, the deitiesâ body, speech and mind are pleased and the great accumulation is simultaneously accomplished.</p>
<h4>Second Portion of Confession</h4>
<p>The offering goddesses each carry a <em>kapÄla</em> filled with the five meats and five amá¹tas, and particularly with red and white bodhicitta. Focus on the offering of the great equal taste of bliss and emptiness. Confess, with strong remorse and regret, any inherently negative deeds or breakages of vowsâimpairments, breakages, transgressions or confusions of the vows of individual liberation, bodhisattva and mantra vehiclesâincurred throughout the course of your lives in beginningless time until now, and ask for forgiveness. Imagine that the assembled deities are delighted and, filled with love, grant forgiveness. All shortcomings and flaws are purified without exception and the impairments<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> in relation to the wisdom deities are restored. Thus, gain firm confidence that in this way the four primordially protected king-like samayas<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> are actualized.</p>
<h4>Third portion, the Liberation Offering</h4>
<p>When the third portion feast substance is placed before the vajra-master, he or she recites â<em>hÅ«á¹</em>â. Thus, the goddesses who previously blessed the sensual delights dissolve back into oneself. The third portion should not be be sanctified with the consecrated water, alcohol, or âinner offeringâ.<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> It is said that if one has a liberation effigy, one should place the third portion within it and move both to the side.<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> In any case, sprinkle that third portion which has captured the life-force(s) with non-consecrated rakta. A realized being who has liberated the self performs âThe Buddhasâ Instructions from the Mantrikaâs Triangular Ritual Fire Pitâ<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> to the beings that are captured in the effigy, such as those who show all the ten grounds,<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> those who have committed the seven violations,<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a> or those who belong to the five kinds of enemies,<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a> all of whom are to be liberated by others with compassion. Through the vajra-masterâs <em>samÄdhi</em> which fulfils the three satisfactions<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a> by being stable, powerful and focused,<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a> the mind is separated from the body. Then, the âflesh and bloodâ<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a> is consecrated with amá¹ta and becomes undefiled wisdom nectar, which in turn is offered. Imagine that the deities enjoy this with delightful and wrathful expressions. All dualistic thoughts, the root of impure saá¹sÄra, are released into the expanse of great non-dual bliss. Thus sustaining the <em>samÄdhi</em> of the primordial purity of the three worlds<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a> is the single key point which perfects all offerings of union and liberation and confession and fulfilment.</p>
<p>Some scriptures explain that the first portion is offered to the general <em>bali</em><a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a> of the three roots; the second portion of confession to the bali of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s; and the third portion of liberation near the malign bali of the lower activities or, if one does not have this bali, to the bali of the protectors. In another tradition one would offer the first portion to the three rootsâ bali and the second and third portionsâthe confession and liberation offeringsânear the bali of the lower activity. One can also offer all three portions near the three rootsâ bali. If it is not easy to offer the three portions near the balis, then it is permitted to simply offer the individual feast plates or the whole feast into in one big bowl. When one performs the fulfilment for the liberation offering, visualize the fulfilment substances through the key points of deity, mantra, <em>mudrÄ</em> and <em>samÄdhi</em>, as Samantabhadraâs vast offering clouds continuously filling the whole expanse of space. Evoke the meaning of each and every word of the ritual manual of whatever feast-offering one follows. If the ritual includes a âsky-offering portionâ, offer this fourth portion outside the shrine room. If the ritual liturgy does not mention the fourth portion, then it is not necessary to offer a substitution.<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a></p>
<p>Next, the ritual assistant(s) distributes the feast to the entire assembly, beginning with the vajra-master. The ritual assistant begins with prostrations and then, with his or her left hand in the 'lotus <em>mudrÄ</em>' and holding the <em>madana</em>,<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a> and with his or her right in the 'three-pointed <em>mudrÄ</em>', he or she recites: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>KyÃ©! Behold all phenomena as excellent! Do not entertain doubts regarding all that is gathered. Eat, regarding brahmins, dogs, and untouchables as having the same nature!<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ritual assistant, with arms crossed, holds the substances of skilful means and wisdom and gives them to the vajra-master. The vajra master, with left hand in the 'lotus <em>mudrÄ</em>'; and right hand in the 'three-pointed <em>mudrÄ</em>' (thumb pressing on the little finger and remaining three fingers extended), takes the feast. It is also permitted that the vajra-master, having performed the 'lotus <em>mudrÄ</em>', takes the feast with both hands joined. Moreover, do not simply start to eat and drink in an ordinary way. Instead, distribute the substances to the assembly without favour or dislike. And do not engage in mindless entertainment such as making jokes. Also, do not be selective about which feast substances one receives. Regarding the downfall of the hawk or wolf-like behaviour, the great Guru of Uá¸á¸iyÄna said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one has craving and is greedy for the feast, one will be reborn as a wolf.<br/>
If one does not know how to enjoy the feast while maintaining the three perceptions, one will be reborn a hungry ghost with a tightly closed mouth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three perceptions are: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>perception of the teacher as the heruka in union,</li>
<li>perception of one's vajra-brothers and sisters as gods and goddesses,</li>
<li>perception of the gaá¹acakra as the siddhis.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that there should be six satisfactions: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>to satisfy the deities of the field of accumulation with outer, inner and secret offerings,</li>
<li>to satisfy the yogins and yoginÄ«s with foods and drinks,</li>
<li>to satisfy the wisdom maá¹á¸ala with the essence of amá¹ta,</li>
<li>to satisfy the deities of the body maá¹á¸ala with the wisdom of bliss and emptiness,</li>
<li>to satisfy the outer and inner á¸ÄkinÄ«s with the offering of songs, and</li>
<li>to satisfy the haughty spirits with the bali.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, delight in the outer, inner and secret gaá¹acakra and, as stated in the great tantra, <em>The Union of the Sun and Moon</em>:<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform the vajra song and dance! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore chant the feast songs,<a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[53]</a> <em>Ema Kiri</em><a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[54]</a> and so forth. Moreover, uphold the three âinseparablesâ: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>the body is inseparable from the iá¹£á¹­adevatÄ,</li>
<li>the speech is in essence inseparable from mantra, and</li>
<li>the mind is inseparable from dharmatÄ.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three freedoms from doubt are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>to be free from doubts regarding the tantras, scriptures and the teacherâs speech,</li>
<li>to be free from the doubts over purity and impurity regarding the maá¹á¸ala of siddhis, and</li>
<li>to be free from doubts regarding the secret conduct.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three prohibitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>do not engage in careless conduct,</li>
<li>do not harbour desire, anger or jealously, and</li>
<li>do not sow disharmony amongst ones vajra-brothers and sisters.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three inappropriate concepts regarding meat and alcohol:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>although one may be a bhiká¹£u, it is inappropriate to harbour concepts,</li>
<li>although one may be a brahmin adhering to purity, it is inappropriate to harbour concepts, and</li>
<li>although one may be a follower of the kriyÄ-action tantras, learned in ritual, it is inappropriate to harbour concepts.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three types of accumulating negativity to be avoided:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>do not accumulate negativity towards the guide, oneâs teacher(s),</li>
<li>do not accumulate negativity towards the oral instructions of the profound path, and</li>
<li>do not accumulate negativity towards friends on the path, oneâs vajra brothers and sisters</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three things that should not be given to the public:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>do not give out the supports for initiations such as sindÅ«ra to the public,</li>
<li>do not give out oneâs portion of the feastâthe support of the blessingsâto the public, and</li>
<li>do not give out the amá¹ta of accomplishment to the public.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three secrets are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>the secret of the time when the gaá¹acakra is to be performed,</li>
<li>the secret of the arrangement of the gaá¹acakra, and</li>
<li>the secret of the method of performance.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The three utterances to be avoided:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>do not utter disrespectful words towards oneâs teacher(s),</li>
<li>do not utter ordinary words during the gaá¹acakra, and</li>
<li>do not utter harsh words towards ones vajra-brothers and sisters.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4>Giving the Remainder Offering</h4>
<p>According to the elaborate explanation, it is best to arrange heaps of human ash upon the skin of a violator.<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a> The second best option is to sprinkle the grains or sand maá¹á¸ala with scented water and rakta. At least, arrange five piles of grains upon whatever support one has. Or, as the <em>Heruka Galpo</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the maá¹á¸ala of the remainder at the north-eastern border,<br/>
Draw with rakta Eâs or crescents upon a âviolatorâs skinâ. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated, additionally in the maá¹á¸ala in the north-east or south-west, draw for the peaceful deities a circular maá¹á¸ala with scented water, and draw for the wrathful deities upon violatorâs skin a <em>dharmodaya</em>,<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a> and a crescent upon a violatorâs skin. </p>
<p>In any case, place a <em>bhÄá¹á¸a</em><a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a> or a copper vessel upon a stand. If you desire mainly pacifying activity, place the pure remainder within the vessel. If you desire mainly wrathful activity, place the impure remainder within the vessel. The recitation, visualisation and so forth [for the ritual] are hidden elsewhere and I shall not explain them here. As before, collect the impure remainder from the whole assembly. However, if it collecting the impure remainder is difficult because too many samaya-holders have assembled, then it is permissible not to collect the impure remainder. In brief, it is explained that the impure remainder is gathered beginning from the ends of the lines and it is excellent if each impure remainder is placed in separate vessels. According to the tradition of my most precious teacher,<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a> this kind advice is given: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pure remainder is placed upon the impure remainder of the vajra-master. Upon this is placed âthe <em>palgyi pabab</em>â â the leftover pieces of the previous offerings.<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a> It is important to include an incense stick during the day and a burning candle at night, in order to avoid a direct encounter<a href="#fn:60" id="fnref:60" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[60]</a> with the remainder guests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some maá¹á¸ala rituals advise that the remainder should be held aloft while the words of the remainder offering are recited. The pure remainder is divided and offered, except for one portion, to the maá¹á¸ala. The remaining portion is placed and used as the pure remainder as explained above. In general, the ritual assistant sprinkles it with amá¹ta and rakta. In order to avoid being poisoned by an encounter with the remainder guests,<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a> the 'lotus <em>mudrÄ</em>' should be performed and the remainder held with the '<em>garuá¸a mudrÄ</em>'.</p>
<p>If a vajra-master with realization of the view is present, some scriptures explain that each of the five families should be performed, but according to the tradition of my precious most teacher, the vajra-master should visualize his or her upper palate as <em>vÄ«ra HayagrÄ«va</em> and his or her lower palate as <em>VajravÄrÄhÄ«</em>. Then, he or she visualizes that, from their point of union, the mind of awakening which has the nature of amá¹ta, and blesses the remainder by spitting three times with the 'secret space <em>mudrÄ</em>'. The first spit purifies all the faults and defects; the second transforms the remainder into the nature of untainted amá¹ta; and the third transforms it into enjoyments of sensual delights which multiply inexhaustibly.</p>
<p>If the vajra-master does not hold the highest view, the remainder is sprinkled with amá¹ta. Were one to spit on it, this would be comparable to the guard contaminating clean food:<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a> it would lead the á¸ÄkinÄ«s to command harsh retribution.</p>
<p>Visualize the remainder feast receptacle as a kapÄla or a vast and extensive lustrous vessel bubbling with wisdom amá¹ta. Imagine within it a variety of outer and inner offerings, such as silken tents, canopies and ribbons, flesh, blood and bones, all of which transform into inexhaustible clouds of offerings that delight the wisdom and worldly invited remainder guests. The remainder guests are those of the seven higher and lower ranks. Those of the seven higher ranks are as stated in the <em>Heruka Galpo</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>those that reside in the spontaneously perfect abode of the naturally pure dharmadhÄtu, and</li>
<li>those of the ranks of the heruka, who are blessed by <em>samÄdhi</em> and become the object of visualization,</li>
<li>the male, skilful means,</li>
<li>the female, wisdom,</li>
<li>the <em>khrodÄ«s</em> of the places,</li>
<li>the <em>piÅacÄ«s</em> of the lands, and</li>
<li>the maá¹á¸ala of the four wisdom gate keepers.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Those of the seven lower ranks are: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>the thirty-two <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em> mentioned in the <em>Secret Moon-Drop</em>,</li>
<li>the eighteen great <em>kiá¹karas</em> mentioned in the <em>YamÄntaka</em> teachings,</li>
<li>the three <em>rÄká¹£asas</em> mentioned in the <em>ÅrÄ« Heruka</em> teachings,</li>
<li>the eight <em>jvÄlas</em> mentioned in the unsurpassed <em>MÄyÄjÄla</em> teachings,</li>
<li>the seven <em>mÄtá¹kÄs</em> and the four <em>bhaginÄ«s</em> mentioned in the mother tantras and scriptures,</li>
<li>the sixty-four <em>dÅ«tÄ«s</em> mentioned in the <em>Mighty Lotus</em>, and</li>
<li>the twenty-eight <em>Ä«ÅvarÄ«s</em> mentioned in the <em>Guhyagarbha</em> to whom both the pure and impure remainder are offered.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Know that all these spirits and deities vary in the appearance of their bodies, faces, hands and characteristics.</p>
<p>The ritual assistant, counting steps of both right and left legs, walks seventy steps away from the practice place. This is called the âfeeding pathway of the raká¹£asasâ. There he or she places the remainder heaped like a stand. Although there are various ways to pile the remainder, they are not explained here. Other texts also suggest making an offering of rinsing water. According to my kind teacher, in order not to be poisoned, within the shrine room and while holding the bali-plate, so that the plate faces oneself, pour rinsing water onto it.<a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a></p>
<p>During a <em>drupchen</em>,<a href="#fn:64" id="fnref:64" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[64]</a> the <em>lhakta</em>, âthe promised remainderâ, is placed in the south-east of the maá¹á¸ala, because that is where the á¸ÄkinÄ«s gather. Generally, it is also said to be placed in the north-east of the maá¹á¸ala. On the day that the remainder is given, the collected remainder is placed altogether as a pile outside.</p>
<p>It is said that a scattered remainder will cause quarrels to arise among vajra-brothers and sisters. Do not give the remainder to beggars and the like, since this is said to lead to inauspiciousness within the country. There is no fault, however, if the remainder is eaten by birds, since they belong to the family of á¸ÄkinÄ«s. It is explained that one should immediately dissolve the visualized remainder maá¹á¸ala once the remainder has been offered. Taking good care of these points regarding the remainder will ensure that the many fierce mundane and super-mundane deities invited to the remainder do not create inauspicious circumstances for you, the ritual assistant, the assembly or the nation.</p>
<h4>Exhortation</h4>
<p>Exhort the deities to take their previously taken samayas seriously. Recite the summoning liturgy for the bali and visualize, while maintaining the three satisfactions, that the offering of flesh and blood transforms into amá¹ta.</p>
<h4>Covenant</h4>
<p>The covenant is given to the protectors of the three classes of tantras who follow the command of the three kÄya teacher(s). Thus, through the giving of the covenant, the protectors are entrusted with the activities of aiding the dharma brothers and sisters and pacifying their obstacles. Pour the rinsing water for the covenant near the bali of the sthÄvarÄs.</p>
<h4>SthÄvarÄs<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a></h4>
<p>The <em>sthÄvarÄ</em> goddesses, as previously commanded by Padmasambhava, are entrusted with the four activities,<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a> such as the protection of Tibet against the threats of heretics and barbarians. In order to avoid angering the <em>sthÄvarÄs</em>, visualize a white silken curtain surrounding the <em>sthÄvarÄ</em> offering.</p>
<h4>Suppression Dance</h4>
<p>In order to suppress the hidden retinue of ghost and spirits, it is crucial that you place the seal while maintaining the view of the inseparability of emptiness and compassion.</p>
<p>Again, recite the offering, praise and confession prayers. Then receive the siddhis, dissolve and re-emerge, dedicate and recite aspirations and prayers of auspiciousness. Here, I shall not explain the individual visualisations for these practices.</p>
<h3>III. Showing the Excellent Benefits of Gathering the gaá¹acakra</h3>
<p>It is stated in <em>The Two Segments</em>:<a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever one eats, all the sensual delights<br/>
For the practitioners will transform into siddhis. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it is said:<a href="#fn:68" id="fnref:68" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[68]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The faults of the transgressions of samaya will be dispelled,<br/>
Everything unfavourable will be defeated,<br/>
One will accomplish whatever one desires,<br/>
One will gather the accumulation of merit,<br/>
All food will bestow siddhis,<br/>
The remainder deities and spirits will be satisfied.<br/>
Through the ritual of the gaá¹acakra,<br/>
Which swiftly grants the prophecy for receiving<br/>
The siddhi of <em>mahÄmudrÄ</em>,<br/>
One will reach the desired goal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Vajra-Net</em><a href="#fn:69" id="fnref:69" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[69]</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst the accumulations of merit, gaá¹acakra is supreme.<br/>
All one's wishes for this life will be accomplished,<br/>
Negative forces and obstacles will be pacified.<br/>
In the next, in the realm of the victorious vidyÄdharas,<br/>
One will reach the level of Samantabhadra. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Saá¹varodaya</em><a href="#fn:70" id="fnref:70" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[70]</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abundant happiness,<br/>
Freedom from disease, a virtuous mind,<br/>
[All] wishes will be fulfilled and final release will be attained.<br/>
Thus abundant siddhis will be gathered. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Naturally Arisen Perfection Tantra</em> states:<a href="#fn:71" id="fnref:71" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[71]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The qualities of gaá¹acakra are as follows:<br/>
The obscurations of countless past and future lives<br/>
Will all be purified in a mere instant in the presence of the peaceful and wrathful deities.<br/>
Wherever one is born in lives to come<br/>
One will never lack necessities,<br/>
The wheel of Dharma will never cease to turn for you<br/>
And one will always have abundant wealth, enjoyments,<br/>
Sustenance and belongings.<br/>
These are the temporary benefits.<br/>
There are also the higher qualities that one will receive:<br/>
In the intermediate state, one will recognize oneâs own perception as the wisdoms.<a href="#fn:72" id="fnref:72" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[72]</a><br/>
Being liberated there, one will remain on the unchanging ground,<br/>
Sending forth emanations throughout the three thousand-fold universe<br/>
To benefit beings.<br/>
Qualities like this one will attain! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>YeshÃ© Tsogyal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the tenth of the waxing moon and on the tenth of the waning moon,<br/>
On the eighth and the fifteenth,<a href="#fn:73" id="fnref:73" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[73]</a><br/>
Gather the gaá¹acakra and make offerings.<br/>
Offering the gaá¹acakra merely once will close the doors to the lower realms,<br/>
And you will not even return and take birth as a human again.<br/>
Understand that this can be established with certainty, through logic. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, the eminent scholar Padma Legdrub<a href="#fn:74" id="fnref:74" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[74]</a> said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, therefore, the qualities of performing the gaá¹acakra are immeasurable. Through it, you will perfect the activities of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing and subjugating. You will restore all impairments and breakages of samaya. You will delight and satisfy the deities, gurus, oath-bound protectors, and vajra brother and sisters. All unfavourable and unwanted circumstances will be dispelled. You will perfect the two accumulations of merit and wisdom. You will simultaneously accomplish supreme and ordinary siddhis. Through this, you will obtain benefits too vast to describe. Since this is the special, profound circumstance, the condition and method of secret mantra, the unsurpassable vajrayÄna, I urge you to strive continuously with diligence!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, Machik LabdrÃ¶n said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst all the conditioned virtues, there is no greater merit than gathering the gaá¹acakra.<br/>
Gathering the gaá¹acakra once, one will be liberated from the age of famine.<a href="#fn:75" id="fnref:75" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[75]</a><br/>
Gathering the gaá¹acakra twice, one will become a universal monarch of the thousand-fold universe.<br/>
Gathering the gaá¹acakra thrice, one will attain the supreme and ordinary siddhis.<br/>
Gathering the gaá¹acakra for a fourth time, attaining the stages of the herukas, one will spontaneously accomplish the twofold benefit,<br/>
And one will travel unobstructedly to the buddha-fields. Thus the benefits are immeasurable! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longchenpa said:<a href="#fn:76" id="fnref:76" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[76]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its excellent benefits are as follows:<br/>
The accumulations of merit and wisdom will be perfected,<br/>
All transgressions of the samayas will be restored,<br/>
Assemblies of á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s will come and gather in the places of the practitioners and accomplish the activities,<br/>
The masters and the gathering of the deities of the maá¹á¸ala will be delighted,<br/>
The ocean of samaya-bound guardians will guard and protect you,<br/>
Your current life will be long, without disease,<br/>

<p>Tib. <em>tshogs kyi âkhor lo bskor ba</em>. Lit. âto gather the gaá¹acakraâ. While the verb <em>bskor ba</em> in Tibetan primarily means âto turnâ, in this context <em>bskor ba</em> means to gather (as/in) the <em>maá¹á¸ala</em> of gaá¹acakra. It is difficult to translate the Sanskrit term <em>gaá¹acakra</em> and its Tibetan equivalent, <em>tshogs kyi âkhor lo</em>, into sensible English. Thus, here I have chosen to render <em>tshogs kyi âkhor lo</em> as gaá¹acakra. Whenever Adzom Gyalse uses the Tibetan abbreviation, <em>tshogs</em>, depending on the context, I have rendered the term either as feast or as gaá¹acakra. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The full title of the tantra is <em>The Tantra of the Great All-Illuminating Bindu</em> (<em>Thig le kun gsal chen poâi rgyud</em>). <em>The Great All-Illuminating Bindu</em> is a tantra of the outer cycle (<em>phyi skor</em>) of the pith-instruction class (<em>man ngag sde</em>) of the <em>Great Perfection</em> (<em>Rdzogs chen</em>) teachings. It provides an outline and explanation of the view, meditation and terminology of the <em>Great Perfection</em>, the highest teachings of the Nyingma School. I was unable to locate the quote passage within the tantra. For a Tibetan edition of the tantra, see: â<em>Thig le kun gsal chen poâi rgyud/</em>,â in <em>Snga âgyur rgyud âbum phyogs bsgrigs/ pod 6/</em>, (Pe cin: Mi rigs dpe skrun khang, 2009), 35b-127b. Please note that Adzom Gyalse has added the explanations in brackets (<em>yig chung</em>) to the quoted passage. For this section, The literal meaning of gaá¹acakra, and for the explanation of The inner gaá¹acakra, Adzom Gyalse follows very closely the presentation of gaá¹acakra as given by Longchenpa in his Guhyagarbha Tantra commentary <em>Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions</em> (<em>Gsang snying âgrel pa phyogs bcu mun sel</em>). For an English translation of the relevant section, see: Longchen Rabjam, <em>The Guhyagarbha Tantra: Secret Essence Definitive Nature Just As It Is</em>, transl. Lama ChÃ¶nam and Sangye Khandro (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 2011): 482-484. (Please note that my translation differs from that of Lama ChÃ¶nam and Sangye Khandro.)

<p>That is that the practitioners must act in accord with the view and conduct prescribed by the tantra practiced.

<p><em>The Stages of Vajra Activity</em> (<em>Rdo rje las rim</em>) likely refers, as also suggested by Sangye Khandro, to a commentary attributed to Buddhaguhya entitled <em>Stages of Vajra Activity [for the MÄyÄjÄla]</em> (<em>MÄyÄjÄlavajrakarma</em>, <em>[Sgyu âphrul dra ba] rdo rje las [kyi] rim pa</em>). However, I was unable to find the quote within this text. Instead, I found the quoted passage within <em>The Magical Net of Vajrasattva, The Mirror of All Secrets</em> (<em>VajrasattvamÄyÄjÄlaguhyasarvÄdarÅa</em>, <em>Rdo rje sems dpaâi sgyu âphrul dra ba gsang ba thams cad kyi me long</em>) attributed to the translators Vimalamitra and JÃ±ÄnakumÄra. In his commentary <em>Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions</em> Longchenpa likewise attributed the passage to <em>The Stages of Vajra Activity</em>. Thus, <em>The Stages of Vajra Activity</em> may be a misattribution, or another title for <em>The Mirror of All Secrets</em>, or the title used for yet another commentary which quotes <em>The Mirror of All Secrets</em>.
